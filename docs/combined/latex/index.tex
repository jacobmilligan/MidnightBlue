\hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d}{M\+B2D} (Midnight Blue engine for 2D) is a free and open source (M\+IT License) 2D game engine built on top of the fantastic Mono\+Game A\+PI. A general purpose engine intended for any genre of 2D game, \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d}{M\+B2D} is code-\/only and uses the Mono\+Game content pipeline for resource management.

\subsection*{Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Complete integration with any Mono\+Game project, just drop the class library in and make your first scene without any extra trouble.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Uses Mono\+Games sprite batch utility with lots of geometry extensions such as drawing a grid!
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Complete, exhaustive documentation available \+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+
\item Entity-\/\+Component based game object system -\/ Flexible and efficient.
\item Scene management system with transitions
\item Complete UI library with buttons, labels, list boxes etc. defined in {\ttfamily Views} that can be attached to any scene
\item IO utilities\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Text input processor for keyboards
\item {\ttfamily Last\+Key\+Typed}, {\ttfamily Last\+Char} etc.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Debug console with tab completion and history that allows adding test and debug functions and variables for use within the game.
\item Efficient collision system that fully covers near and broad phases, just add a {\ttfamily Collision\+Component} and A\+A\+BB to an entity. What exactly does efficient mean, though? The \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d}{M\+B2D} showcase game, Midnight Blue, is checking collisions against 5,000 on-\/screen A\+A\+BB\textquotesingle{}s at once at well over 60\+F\+PS.
\item Physics System -\/ setup a physics environment (with inertia etc.) and the engine takes care of everything else.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Currently only supports physics for top-\/down games but side scrollers and other types are well on the way.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Event-\/based input command system -\/ commands can be assigned to one or many keys mapped to triggers.
\item Tile Map with collisions
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tiles have flags and can change behavior based on them
\item Tile map uses a single tile image and divides it up based on your specifications
\item Support for {\itshape Tiled} tile maps is in the works
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Audio triggers and components
\item Inventory system is on the way
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Getting Started}

Right now, \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d}{M\+B2D} still has a dependency on Mono\+Game for spritebatching, content management, and some primitives so you\textquotesingle{}ll need to download that and install on your system. Then download the \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d}{M\+B2D} D\+LL from \+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+ and add to your projects packages.

Everything in \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d}{M\+B2D} happens in {\ttfamily Scenes} which makes getting started with a game super easy -\/ All you need is {\ttfamily Main} and a {\ttfamily Scene}.

First, create a new scene\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{using} \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d}{MB2D}.\hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d_1_1_entity_component}{EntityComponent};
\textcolor{keyword}{using} \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d}{MB2D}.\hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d_1_1_scenes}{Scenes};
\textcolor{keyword}{using} Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content;
\textcolor{keyword}{using} Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;

\textcolor{keyword}{namespace }ExampleMB2D
\{
  \textcolor{comment}{// My first scene}
  \textcolor{keyword}{public} \textcolor{keyword}{class }HelloScene : Scene
  \{
    \textcolor{comment}{// Initializes a new instance of the HelloScene class.}
    \textcolor{keyword}{public} HelloScene(EntityMap gameObjects, ContentManager content) : base(gameObjects, content)
    \{

    \}

    \textcolor{comment}{// Runs any initialization logic and transitions until}
    \textcolor{comment}{// the transition state is changed}
    \textcolor{keyword}{public} \textcolor{keyword}{override} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} Initialize()
    \{

      \textcolor{comment}{// Required otherwise the initialize transition will never end}
      \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d_1_1_scenes_a0e0db3f97bbaa272f70534c5954c4acc}{TransitionState} = \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d_1_1_scenes_a0e0db3f97bbaa272f70534c5954c4acc}{TransitionState}.None;
    \}

    \textcolor{comment}{// Handles the input for the scene.}
    \textcolor{keyword}{public} \textcolor{keyword}{override} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} HandleInput() 
    \{
        \textcolor{comment}{// all input logic should go here}
    \}

    \textcolor{comment}{// Updates the scene.}
    \textcolor{keyword}{public} \textcolor{keyword}{override} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} Update() 
    \{
        \textcolor{comment}{// all game logic should happen here}
    \}

    \textcolor{comment}{// Draws the scene to the spriteBatch and uiSpriteBatch.}
    \textcolor{comment}{// spriteBatch - Sprite batch for world-based entities.}
    \textcolor{comment}{// uiSpriteBatch - User interface sprite batch for screen-based items}
    \textcolor{keyword}{public} \textcolor{keyword}{override} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch, SpriteBatch uiSpriteBatch)
    \{
        \textcolor{comment}{// draw everything to the spriteBatch for world-based coordinates and to uiSpriteBatch for
       camera-based coordinates}
    \}

    \textcolor{comment}{// Exits the scene and runs any transitions until}
    \textcolor{comment}{// the transition state is changed. Once this transition}
    \textcolor{comment}{// finishes the scene will be gone for good.}
    \textcolor{keyword}{public} \textcolor{keyword}{override} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} Exit()
    \{
      \textcolor{comment}{// Required otherwise the exit transition will never end}
      \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d_1_1_scenes_a0e0db3f97bbaa272f70534c5954c4acc}{TransitionState} = \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d_1_1_scenes_a0e0db3f97bbaa272f70534c5954c4acc}{TransitionState}.Null;
    \}

    \textcolor{comment}{// Pauses the scene and runs any transitions until}
    \textcolor{comment}{// the transition state is changed}
    \textcolor{keyword}{public} \textcolor{keyword}{override} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} Pause()
    \{
      \textcolor{comment}{// Required otherwise the pause transition will never end}
      \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d_1_1_scenes_a0e0db3f97bbaa272f70534c5954c4acc}{TransitionState} = \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d_1_1_scenes_a0e0db3f97bbaa272f70534c5954c4acc}{TransitionState}.None;
    \}

    \textcolor{comment}{// Resumes the scene and runs any transitions until}
    \textcolor{comment}{// the transition state is changed}
    \textcolor{keyword}{public} \textcolor{keyword}{override} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} Resume()
    \{
      \textcolor{comment}{// Required otherwise the resume transition will never end}
      \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d_1_1_scenes_a0e0db3f97bbaa272f70534c5954c4acc}{TransitionState} = \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d_1_1_scenes_a0e0db3f97bbaa272f70534c5954c4acc}{TransitionState}.None;
    \}
  \}
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


Now define a Main entry point with a new {\ttfamily M\+B\+Game} class passing in the type of scene you want the game to start with, in this case {\ttfamily Hello\+Scene}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{using} \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d}{MB2D};

\textcolor{keyword}{namespace }ExampleMB2D
\{
  \textcolor{keyword}{static} \textcolor{keyword}{class }ExampleMB2D
  \{
    \textcolor{keyword}{private} \textcolor{keyword}{static} MBGame game;
    \textcolor{keyword}{static} \textcolor{keywordtype}{void} Main(\textcolor{keywordtype}{string}[] args)
    \{
      game = \textcolor{keyword}{new} MBGame(typeof(HelloScene));
      game.Run();
      game.Dispose(); \textcolor{comment}{// important to get rid of resources}
    \}
  \}
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


And that\textquotesingle{}s it! Use the Mono\+Game pipeline tool to import any resources needed, otherwise enjoy M\+B2\+D! 



\section*{Midnight Blue}

Explore the horizon in a procedurally generated galaxy consisting of thousands of star systems and hundreds of thousands of planets in your ship, the {\bfseries Midnight Blue}.

\subsection*{The Game}

Built initially as a showcase for \hyperlink{namespace_m_b2_d}{M\+B2D}, a code-\/only 2D game engine built on top of Mono\+Game, Midnight Blue is currently a top-\/down space simulation, with the ability to travel across the galaxy, traverse star systems, land on planets with varied biomes and explore them to an eerie synth opera soundtrack. However, the plans for the game are much greater with the following in the works\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Trade posts and Civilisations} -\/ Visit and interact with procedurally generated civilisations of different factions, trading with merchants across the galaxy.
\item {\bfseries Resource gathering and management} -\/ Upgrade your ship and equipment.
\item {\bfseries Economy} -\/ A fluctuating economy between star systems and planets as differing resource availabilities and demands, faction alleigences, and environment play into a dynamic economy.
\item {\bfseries Factions and Races} -\/ Develop relationships with different factions and races which impact the economy and your ability to safely travel across space.
\item {\bfseries Top-\/\+Down Shooting action} -\/ When relationships hit boiling point, fighting can break out, also unknown forces lie across the vast galaxy and not all of them are nice...
\end{DoxyItemize}

# Midnight Blue

Explore the horizon in a procedurally generated galaxy consisting of thousands of star systems and hundreds of thousands of planets in your ship, the **Midnight Blue**.

## The Game

Built initially as a showcase for MB2D, a code-only 2D game engine built on top of MonoGame, Midnight Blue is currently a top-down space simulation, with the ability to travel across the galaxy, traverse star systems, land on planets with varied biomes and explore them to an eerie synth opera soundtrack. However, the plans for the game are much greater with the following in the works:

* **Trade posts and Civilisations** - Visit and interact with procedurally generated civilisations of different factions, trading with merchants across the galaxy.
* **Resource gathering and management** - Upgrade your ship and equipment.
* **Economy** - A fluctuating economy between star systems and planets as differing resource availabilities and demands, faction alleigences, and environment play into a dynamic economy.
* **Factions and Races** - Develop relationships with different factions and races which impact the economy and your ability to safely travel across space.
* **Top-Down Shooting action** - When relationships hit boiling point, fighting can break out, also unknown forces lie across the vast galaxy and not all of them are nice...
